# SimpleDB
A simple RDBMS written in Java. Adapted from [Edward Sciore](http://cs.bc.edu/~sciore/simpledb/).

Upon the skeleton of SimpleDB, new features are implemented:
* WHERE predicates: both equality and non-equality
* Indexing: hash and B+ tree
* ORDER BY and DISTINCT clauses
* GROUP BY clauses for simple aggregate functions: SUM, COUNT, AGV, MIN, MAX
* Join algorithms: Block nested loop, Index based, Sort merge, Hash join
* Query planner and optimizer

SimpleDB has now turned to SimpleDB+. Let's try to reach SimpleDB++ soon.. ðŸ˜ƒ
